	A cursed Wordle de-make

Hey you know what's a great idea? An app
that needs a working RTC clock on a
platform that predominantly didn't have
one. My favorite autofolder time setting
tool has been included.

The .PRG can be renamed to .ACC to run
as a desk accessory.

To make it easy for people to run the
game logic through its paces, this
version somewhat awkwardly flips between
the Daily Curd which gives you a
different word every day like the
original and tracks stats, and Free Play
mode which picks random words and does
not effect stats.

I will probably make these two different
binaries.

Currently the game picks from the entire
wordle word list, including obscure
words, after playing with this a bit I
don't think it is that fun. Next version
will implement the common wordlist.

development and other retrocomputing
shenanigans please check out my Ko-fi:
